/**
 * This enum models the types of connection events that happen to a peripherl. There is no symetry between
 * connect success/failure and disconnected. This is because disconnection always succeeds, and an error object
 * does not indicate the device is still connected.
 *
 * The periheral is informed of the connection and disconnection events via the `onDisconnect` block. The
 * intent of the block is to inform the user that the connection succeeded, failed, or that the device was disconnected.
 * The consumer can use this information to determine what action to perform for connection maintainence.
 *
 * This does not reflect the state of the peripheral, continue to use CBPeripheral.state for that information.
